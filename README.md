My Final project focusses on the presence of size-dependent neurons in Alzheimer's Disease patients. Ranging from 5 - 200 micrometers in diameters. Size-dependent neuronal loss is a common mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease. Data shows selective, size-dependent neuronal loss and assess potential relationship between sex, age, and neuronal loss. For more information, see Final Project Folder.
